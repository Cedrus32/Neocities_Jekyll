Yet again a big update to my tama collection. Found okay deals on several Connection V4.5's and jumped on a deam shell Uratama.

        <p>I purchased "Guts Swimming" with "Guts Summer". It took this long to arrive! The inside of the shell was grimy and the A button stuck. After a light cleaning it's operating much better.</p>

        <p>I love the colors on the "Girls Rock" shell. Enough said.</p>

        <p>This was a bit of an impulse buy, but I was able to talk the seller down a bit from their asking price. The listing described the charms as a "bee" and "green monster".</p>

        <p>This was a fun find! I was surprised to see it sent from Fort Meade. I call this my "NSA" tama.</p>

        <p>This is one of my favorite uratama shells. The colors and shapes are incredible!</p>
